FaaSner

Introduction
-
This is the documentation section for FaaSner. FaaSner is a provider for Function as a Service. Having experimented with a lot of providers and yet not getting the desired output , I decided to write something on my own and more importantly provided a rich documentation around it.
The proposal is to make use of a very detailed approach to solving the same set of problems but give the software its due , document everything in every possible aspect.


Prerequisites
-
* Docker swarm is initialized on the host


Core Assumptions
-
* Each piece of software should exist as a docker image.
* Installed docker image for supporting faasner should use a prefix "faasner-"
